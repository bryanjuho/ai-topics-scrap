# Prompt Engineering

- Prompt Engineering? It is the art and science of designing and tweaking natural language instructions, or "prompts", that guide AI tools and services like ChatGPT to perform specific tasks. These prompts are the key to unlocking the full potential of artificial intelligence and unleashing its productivity benefits.

- LLaMA is a product of Meta AI, trained on a massive dataset of over 1.4 trillion tokens, making it larger than GPT-3. LLaMA's success highlights the continued competition in the field of natural language processing and the potential for even larger and more powerful language models in the future.

## Key points

- Shown to outperform OpenAI's GPT-3 (ChatGPT).
- LLaMA has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several benchmarks.
- Open source (almost)
    - Models are only open to academic researchers (Application needed)
